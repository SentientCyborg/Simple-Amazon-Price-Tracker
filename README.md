# Simple-Amazon-Price-Tracker
This program scrapes Amazon for the price of a specific product (Instant Pot Duo) and sends an email alert if the price 
drops below a certain threshold.

This program only gets the price one time. The program was designed with the intent of hosting it online and running as 
a scheduled task. 

To run this program, **update the headers and all the email variables** with your information.


If you want to try searching for a different product, the product URL (and target price) can be changed, but be advised 
that I did not test any other product URLs.
